# HashMap_Implementation
A templated HashMap class which supports duplicate keys, done as an assignment for my OOP class.

A HashMap instantiation recieves three arguments: the data type for keys, the data type for values and a hashing class.

A default hashing class is also implemented, which supports basic data types: int, long, long long, unsigned, unsigned long, unsigned long long, float, double, long double and string. For any other data types, the user will have to define their own hashing class.
